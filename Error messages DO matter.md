The term UX is also applicable to the process of software development.
And error messages are quite important.

Search for this text:

> Module not found: Error: Can't resolve ...

and discover how many people have hit this problem, which probably won't occur, if message was augmented with this:

> Maybe you meant the <em>relative<em/> path rather than the module.
